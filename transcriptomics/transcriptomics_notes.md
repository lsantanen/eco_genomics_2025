### Transcriptomics Module

This is a place for me to keep my notes on my electronic/server activities during the transcriptomics module

### 10/07/2025: Intro to Study System

-   Learned about the motivation and process of asking questions and analyzing RNAseq data

-   Started to run fastp to clean and visualize the data quality in our fastq files, but ran into file recognition issues

-   To be continued on Thursday

### 10/09/2025: Clean and Visualize Reads

-   Provided script was copied and saved into `transcriptomics/myscripts` and is called `fastp_tonsa.sh`

-   Tried to run `fastp_tonsa.sh` scripts, but ran into errors and timing issues

-   Scripts were taking too long to run, so created a wrapper with the `fastp_tonsa.sh` and `salmon_quant.sh` and ran sbatch in the terminal so everything would be ready for next class

### 10/14/2025: Mapping and Counts Matrix

-   Discussion of why mapping rate is so low, likely because the clade was mismatched

-   Species is so diverged that it should be considered a subspecies

-   start with a fastq file

    -   go through cleaning, mapping, DGE analysis

    -   Making decisions all along the way that can impact results

    -   Test things along the way to see how the results are effected

-   PCA predictions

    -   Controls cluster
    -   G1 in treatment cluster further away
    -   Replicates within a group cluster with each other
    -   In the treatment-gradation from G1 to G4
    -   Control, maybe adaptation/acclimation

-   Factors

    -   Temperature line
    -   Generation

-   General framework

    -   GE\~Line+Gen+Line:Gen

-   Used the code

    \grep -r --include "*.log" -e "Mapping rate"\
    \| sed -E 's\|/logs/.*:.\*Mapping rate = ([0-9.]+)%\|\t\1\|'

in the terminal to create a txt file in `myresults\` to see the mapping rates

-   Roughly 40% mapping rate

-   Created an R code to create a counts matrix `create_counts_matrix.r` is saved in `myscripts` and the output is a txt file called `counts_matrix.txt` saved under `mydata`

    -   Note since this is an R script it needs to be run one line at a time, so need to click down through each line
    -   Needed to change `write.txt` to `write.table` and the rest of the code told it to be a `txt` file
    -   The code used is saved under Transcriptomics Tutorial 3

-   The code run above prepped `quant.sf` files to be imported into DESeq2

**DESeq2 start of data analysis**

-   copied the `metadata.txt` file from the class directory into `mydata`

-   created an R markdown to visualize the reads and variation

-   explored patterns in the data

-   defined the DESeq2 object

-   stopped here and will create a PCA plot next time

### 10/16/2025: Gene Expression and Analysis Continued (DESeq cont.)

-   Opened `DESeq_notes.rmd` from last class located in `mydocs`

-   Last class was data exploration, and this time we will run DESeq2

-   Left off talking about expected patterns of PCA

-   Pick up with actually making the PCA from the tutorial

-   Looking at two different types of distributions

    -   See average expression from 0 to 15,000 and a line of average expression (std dev)

-   Made a heat map based on the sample distance matrix, how dissimilar is each sample from every other sample

-   Along 1:1 line is the sample compared to itself

    -   Nothing too crazy in the results

-   Moved on to making a cluster tree to see outlier samples (`hclust`)

    -   No outliers just like as seen in the previous step

-   Now onto PCA...

    -   Distinct clustering of G4 in control and treatment

    -   G1 and G4 are separated by PC1

    -   All generations separated along PC1, which explains 32% of the variance

    -   PC2 splits control and treatment for G3 and G2

    -   PC axes are larger than we've seen previously, which is based on the data

        -   DNA vs RNA - what are you looking at

-   Made another PCA graph to try an optimize the data visualization

-   Move on to testing for differential gene expression using the group model

-   Pull out results of interest and reorder them by significance

-   Plot individual genes

    -   Just input the gene names into the code to see the expressions

-   All work was done in `DESeq2_notes.rmd`

-   Continue next week with heat map, MA plot, and Euler plot

### 10/21/2025: Continue Data Visualization (DESeq cont.)

-   Reminder: `DESeq_notes.rmd` is saved under `mydocs` and has been used continuously since 10/14
-   Left off last week on plotting individual genes, this time move on to making an MA plot
-   Updated code was provided for plotting individual genes to make a clearer graph, so code was updated in `DESeq_notes.rmd`
    -   Gene name is listed as "XXX" in code but can be filled in with any of the genes directly above
-   The tutorial has typical questions above each code chunk for the plots
    -   i.e. what does this plot potentially answer
-   Create a heatmap to visualize the top 100 genes
-   Explore differentially expressed genes from each generation
    -   Created and saved results files for all the different contrasts from each generation
-   Take the sig genes from G1 and create a heatmap to see how they change across generations
    -   See if we can make the same plot focusing on the generation 2 significant genes
    -   Change every instance of `G1` in code to `G2` and change matrix name from `lfc_mat` to `lfc_mat2` to ensure there's no interference with original graph
    -   Can see there's more genes expressed in G2 than in G1
    -   Can see that G1, G3, and G4 are all more similar to each other than to G2
-   Go on to make a Venn or Euler plot
    -   Focus on comparing G1, G2, and G3 because G3 and G4 are very similar and making a Venn diagram with 4 categories becomes very complicated
        -   Not every comparison is able to be made and there are too many categories which makes it very tedious to calculate
    -   Overlapping 214 genes are most likely doing opposite things in the two different generations (G1 and G2)
    -   Based on the previous plots made
-   Make sure to have `library(eulerr)` loaded to make the Euler plot
    -   Can have it up at the top of the code with the other loaded libraries, or can just add it to the top of the code chunk - either way run it first!

### 10/23/2025: DESeq2 to TopGO

-   Created a new R markdown file called `DESeq2toTopGO.rmd` and saved it in `mydocs`
-   Using the outputs we created last class from DESeq2 we started putting data into TopGO
-   Created a few different plots to visualize data a bit before exploring all the differentially expressed genes
    -   Looked at differential expression contrast, distribution of results, relationships between the metrics, and a density plot with a rugplot to understand what was tested in the functional enrichment test
-   Then ran TopGO to see the GO enrichment
-   Created an output txt file called `topGOsig_for_REVIGO.txt` which can be copy-pasted into revigo and see the results that it outputs like different plots
-   Note for markdown script created today, the paths weren't working although the root directory was loaded, so all files had to have the complete path with them

### 10/28/2025: Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis

-   Mini lecture on WGCNA with summary in the tutorials website

-   Start by creating a new Rmarkdown file called `DESeq2toWGCNA.rmd` saved under `mydocs`

-   Copy `WGCNA_TraitData.csv` into `mydata` then import into code to filter gene expression based on variance

-   Choose a set of soft-thresholding powers

    -   Output shows graphs with a desired R\^2 of .8

-   For network construction choose a soft-threshold between 16-24 (17) and create a network construction output file called `bwnet_results_WGCNA.RData` saved under `mydata` that can be used for future codes

-   Create a dendrogram of the modules

    -   gray module should always be the largest and functions as a sort of "catch-all"

-   Test for correlation between the eigenvalues and ULT trait data for each module

    -   output is a heat map where the highest value is the category that we want to further investigate (midnight blue)

-   Plot the eigenvalues by treatment and line conditions (using midnight blue)

    -   the output is a graph of each of the eigenvalues vs generation

-   Go back to the GO analysis that we did last class

-   See what GO categories are present and create a list of them to put into REVIGO to view the complete GO analysis

-   All of the work done today is saved in the `DESeq2toWGCA.rmd` file which is saved in `mydocs` with the other markdown files from transcriptomics

-   All the code is provided on the Tutorial 6 page in github

### 11/01/2025: Homework 2

-   What are the functional differences among genes differentially
    expressed at G1 vs. G2 vs. G3 vs. G4? To address this question, you
    would use DESeq2 to set up your contrasts of interest, export your
    results to use as input for TopGO, compare GO enrichment results using
    REViGO or another platform.

-   Chose the question above

-   Started by creating a copy of `DESeq2toTopGO.rmd` and naming it `Homework 2.Rmd` which is also saved under `mydocs`

    -   Figured out the issue with loading files from class the first code chunk did not have `{r setup, include=FALSE}` at the top it only had `{r}`, so that has been fixed in this file

-   In class, only ran TopGO for G2, so create graphs for all gens with the biological function vs -log10-classicFisher

-   Use same code chunk from class just change to G1, G2, G3, or G4 as needed

-   Do same process with code to make txt file with info to put into REVIGO

-   Each of the generations in the code has a line of \#### betweeen them to make it clear where each generation starts and ends

-   Accidentally saved output files into `mydata`, moved them into `mydocs` to stay consistent with where the other files relevant to these analyses are stored

-   Each gen has a different amount of genes printed into the txt file

    -   Gen1: 32

    -   Gen2: 201

    -   Gen3: 83

    -   Gen4: 71

    -   Each GO Enrichment plot only had 30 genes on it

    -   Maybe just take top 30 from each txt file?

-   For final comparison use the main categories shown in the tree map from each Gen to discuss differences between generations

-   Colors on tree map represent superclusters that group terms that are similar - comparison could be what superclusters are in each generation? And how many superclusters each generation has?

-   Need to go to office hours to check

-   Edited code chunk that creates `topGOsig_for_REVIGO.txt` files so if the code needs to be run again the output will print into `mydocs`
